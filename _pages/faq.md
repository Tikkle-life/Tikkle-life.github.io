# **Tikkle FAQ**

Welcome to the Tikkle FAQ!
Here you'll find answers to common questions about how Tikkle works, how to list and discover items, and how to stay safe on the platform.

---

## **General**

**Q: What is Tikkle?**

A: Tikkle is your friendly neighborhood marketplace where local community members can list and find items to buy and sell with one another. We connect neighbors so that you can discover useful items nearby and transact directly with other users.

Tikkle is a listing and discovery platform only. All purchase arrangements and payments are made directly between Buyers and Sellers outside of the Tikkle platform.

**Q: Do you handle payments on Tikkle?**

A: Not at this time. Tikkle does not process, store, or facilitate payments through the platform. Buyers and Sellers arrange payment terms independently off-platform (e.g., in person, cash, peer-to-peer payment apps, etc.).

If we introduce in-app payments in the future, we'll let you know and update our Terms and FAQ accordingly.

**Q: Do you handle delivery?**

A: No. Tikkle does not provide shipping or delivery services. Buyers and Sellers coordinate pickup or delivery directly with each other.

## **Listings & Buying/Selling**

**Q: What can I sell on Tikkle?**

A: You can list almost any type of item that is legal and compliant with our [Terms of Service](/terms/). Popular categories include tools, sporting goods, electronics, furniture, home items, and more.

Check our [Terms of Service](/terms/) for a full list of prohibited items.

**Q: How do I list an item?**

A:

1. Create your free account.
2. Tap **Add Listing** or **List Item**.
3. Upload clear photos and fill in a description.
4. Set your desired price.
5. Publish.

Listings are free — you pay nothing to create a listing.

**Q: Are there fees to list or sell items?**

A: No — listings are free. Tikkle does not charge any platform fees for buy/sell transactions at this time. All payment arrangements and any associated costs (fees for cash-app services, bank transfer fees, etc.) are between the Buyer and Seller.

**Q: How do I find items near me?**

A: Use the search bar and filters on the app or website to browse listings in your area. You can filter by category, location, and keywords to quickly find what you're looking for.

## **Safety, Communication & Transactions**

**Q: Can other users see my messages?**

A: Conversations between users are private (visible only to participants). Tikkle may monitor interactions only if needed to enforce policies or in response to abuse reports consistent with our [Privacy Policy](/privacy/).

**Q: How do I stay safe when transacting with others?**

A:

* Meet in public, well-lit places.
* Bring a friend with you if possible.
* Confirm item details before agreeing to meet.
* Use clear photos and accurate descriptions.
* Communicate through the Tikkle messaging tools when possible.

Tikkle does not guarantee item condition or safety — all transactions and meetups are arranged directly between users.

**Q: What should I do if something goes wrong?**

A: Try first to resolve issues directly with the other user. If you are unable to resolve it, contact support@tikkle.life for assistance, and we can help the best we can under our current policy framework.

## **Moderator Policies & Community Standards**

**Q: What happens if someone breaks the rules?**

A: Tikkle aims to maintain a safe, respectful community. Users who violate the Terms of Service or Guidelines may face warnings, suspensions, or permanent removal from the platform.

**Q: Do you change the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy?**

A: Yes. As Tikkle evolves, we may update our Terms, Privacy Policy, and FAQ to reflect new features and legal requirements. We'll notify users of substantial changes as described in the Terms.

## **Future Features**

**Q: Will you support in-app payments or rental features?**

A: We are working on enhancements, including possible in-app payments and rental features. These will be introduced through updated Terms, Privacy Policy addendums, and product release announcements.

Stay tuned for updates!
